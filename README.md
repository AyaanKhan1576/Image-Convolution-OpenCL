# SIMD-Optimized Edge Detection using OpenCL and C++

This project implements a high-performance 2D convolution on grayscale images using both a scalar C++ baseline and a parallelized OpenCL version. The goal is to compare performance between scalar CPU execution and SIMD-accelerated GPU/CPU execution using OpenCL.

It supports input from real grayscale images (`.pgm`) or generates synthetic images. The OpenCL kernel performs vectorized operations using `float4` to exploit data-level parallelism.

---

## Features

- Vertical edge detection using a 3×3 kernel
- Scalar C++ baseline for performance comparison
- OpenCL version with SIMD-style vectorization (`float4`)
- Supports both CPU and GPU OpenCL devices
- PGM image input/output (compatible with GIMP, IrfanView, OpenCV)
- Benchmark-ready with execution time measurement

---

## Convolution Kernel

The project uses a vertical edge detection kernel:

```
 1  0  -1  
 1  0  -1  
 1  0  -1
```

This kernel detects vertical changes in intensity by computing the difference between left and right columns of pixel values.

## How to Run

### Scalar Version

```bash
./Q1_Scalar
```

- Prompts you to load `input.pgm` or generate a synthetic image.
- Applies scalar convolution.
- Saves result to `output_scalar.pgm`.

---

### OpenCL Version

```bash
./Q1_OpenCL
```

- Prompts to:
  1. Select OpenCL device (CPU or GPU)
  2. Choose image input (load or generate)
- Runs OpenCL kernel
- Saves result as `output_opencl_device_X.pgm`

## SIMD Optimizations in OpenCL

- Used `float4` to group 3 vertically adjacent pixels from each side (left/right)
- Vector subtraction and dot product for fast sum computation:
  ```c
  float4 diff = left - right;
  float sum = dot(diff, (float4)(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
  ```
- Work-items are distributed per-pixel
- Global memory is used efficiently; local memory can be added for further optimization

---

## Challenges Faced

- GPU overhead for small images led to slower performance vs CPU
- Manual device selection was implemented for flexibility
- Memory alignment was required for vectorized `float4` access

---

## Output Visualization

- Open output `.pgm` files using:
  - GIMP
  - IrfanView
  - OpenCV (Python/C++)
  - VSCode with PGM viewer plugin
